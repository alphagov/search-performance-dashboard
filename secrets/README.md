Secrets

Google analytics
----------------

To make the data-fetch from Google Analytics work, some credentials need to be
added to this directory: `client_secrets.json` needs to be created, as
described in [the GA
tutorial](https://developers.google.com/analytics/solutions/articles/hello-analytics-api)

This file should not be added to git!
